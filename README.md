# deep-learning-demo
Here is a short demo of some of my most recent DL projects I've been working on.

To get started, you can either look at the .html file to view what the output of the jupyter notebook will look like,
or if you'd like to run and play with the code yourself, you can clone the project. If you choose to clone the project,
you will need to download either Anaconda or Miniconda and then run this command within the project: 
'conda create --name <env> --file req.txt'. This will resolve all the needed dependencies for you.
